### Mandatory Lab 5: Processing Channel Zaps


Implementation of a Zap Event Processing Server(in Golang including RPC client and server) that processes events generated by a simulated traffic generator that broadcast to the multicast address and port 225.224.0.1.130:10000 .

<br/>




Below is shown a few samples of the message format of the zap events generated:

```
2013/07/20, 21:57:48, 98.202.244.97, FEM, TVNORGE
2013/07/20, 21:57:44, 12.23.36.158, Canal 9, MAX
2013/07/20, 21:57:46, 81.187.186.219, TV2 Bliss, TV2 Zebra
2013/07/20, 21:57:42, 61.77.4.101, TV2 Film, TV2 Bliss

```

| Field No. | Field Name | Description |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Date | The date that the event was sent. |
| 2 | Time | The time that the event was sent. |
| 3 | IP | The IPv4 address of the sending set-top box unit. |
| 4 | FromChan | The previous channel of the set-top box. |
| 5 | ToChan | The new channel of the set-top box. |

**How to run:**
********************************************************************************************


**UDP_server.go**

There are two storage methods, map-based and slice-based.
Map-based storage solution is activated by default.  
Activating/deactivaing can be done under func handleClient(conn *net.UDPConn)

Compute top-10 channels are aslo activated by default.
Different features like memory profiling can be activated by uncommenting those functions under main().

*******************************************************************************************
**RPCserver.go**

Run as usual, default port is set to 55555.

*******************************************************************************************
**RPCclient.go**  
Takes two arguments, IP and portnumber.  

An example:  
If RPCserver.go is run on the same computer as RPCclient.go then input 127.0.0.1:55555 as arguments.

<br/>

The user will then be prompted for a name and desired refreshrate on the subscription.    
To unsubscribe from the server and exit hold down the keys "CTRL + C".  
To exit without unsubscribing hold down the keys "CTRL + Z".
